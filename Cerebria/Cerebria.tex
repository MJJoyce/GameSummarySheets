\subsection*{Player Setup}
\begin{itemizeCustom}
    \item Give each team their team board and determine side both teams will use.
    \item Place 3 Ambition tokens on team board inactive side up.
    \item Shuffle team's Hidden Ambitions and put face down on team board. Look at top card. Can't ever match current Common Aspiration.
    \item Give each team Fragments, Intensity tokens, and Vibe tokens.
    \item Each player picks Spirit and takes figure and board. Each team should use same Spirit board sides.
    \item Each player builds Emotion deck. Top card of each emotion deck is always face up.
    \item Set out deck of Strong Emotions. Give each team their starting emotions (Bleakness / Brightness)
    \item Place Action Tracker token on Spirit board.
    \item Place 2 Essence and 4 Willpower from general supply onto each Player board.
\end{itemizeCustom}

\subsection*{Final Steps}
\begin{itemizeCustom}
    \item Take players' Order markers and randomly determine order. One team 1st/3rd, other team 2nd/4th.
    \item Starting player gets 2 more Willpower but flips over Action Tracker token.
    \item In player order, place Spirits and Starting Emotions
        \begin{enumerateCustom}
            \item Place Spirit on empty Frontier space.
            \item Place Starting Emotion into adjacent Realm emotion spot.
            \item Place 1 Essence from general supply onto Emotion.
        \end{enumerateCustom}
    \item Determine Realm / Frontier control
    \item Draw 2 emotion cards each. In player order, place 4 wild Vibe tokens on Spirit Actions.
\end{itemizeCustom}

\section*{Goal of the Game}
    Take control of Cerebria for 1 of 2 opposing forces, Spirit or Gloom. Score points by completing Intentions, meeting requirements of Aspirations (Common and Hidden) which are checked during Revelations, and build Cerebria's Identity by adding your force's Fragments to the Origin.

\section*{Gameplay}
Players take turns in player order.

\begin{itemizeCustom}
    \item Players take 3 Actions. May take same Action more than once.
    \item 10 possible Actions, 5 Spirit Actions and 5 Realm Actions
    \item Teams share 3 Ambition Abilities which may be used before / after any Action, if you have Ambition available. Each ability may only be used once per turn.
    \item May use Absorb Ability once per turn.
    \item At end of turn: Flip 1 Ambition token to "available" side \textbf{OR} draw 2 Emotion cards. If you have 0 Willpower, gain 1. Flip Action Tracker token to show Absorb Ability is available again.

\begin{enumerateCustom}
    \item \textbf{Last Common Aspiration scored:} Game ends if it's not possible to proceed to new Common Aspiration after Revelation.
    \item \textbf{Team would score Fragment during Revelation but has none of needed type remaining:} Team adds Capping Fragment to Identity after all other Fragments, including Fortresses, have been added. If both teams would add Capping fragment, team that triggered Revelation adds theirs and other team scores 4 points.
    \item \textbf{Team acquires $\ge$ 20 points on Wheel of Intentions.}
\end{enumerateCustom}

\subsection*{Final Scoring}
