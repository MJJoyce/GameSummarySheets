{"name":"GameSummarySheets","tagline":"Rule summary sheets for various board games.","body":"### Welcome to my Game Summary Sheets\r\nBelow you'll find a list of rule summary sheets that I've made for various board games that I own. I enjoy having these when I'm teaching new players, for reference during a game, or as a quick reminder of how to play.\r\n\r\nThe sheets are written in Latex so most people should take a peek at the available PDFs. If you find any errors feel free to send a pull request with a fix or simply send me a message. You can find a copy of the original Latex template that I use under the [TexTemplate folder](https://github.com/MJJoyce/GameSummarySheets/tree/master/TexTemplate).
