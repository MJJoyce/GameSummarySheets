\section*{Additional Rules}
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Raid Effects - Triggered when the hall is refilled. Ignore during setup.
	\item Breach Effects - Triggered when the monster reaches rank 1 of the dungeon hall. Only happens once, even if the monster stays in the first rank 1 for multiple turns. Ignore during setup.
	\item Familiar - Once per game, as a Spoils ability after defeating a monster, you may draw a familiar. Place face up in front of you. Stays in play until you use one of its abilities. May use any or all of its abilities in one turn. Must pay XP to use the abilities. Discard familiar at end of turn when an ability is used.
	\item Horde Monsters - Shuffle placeholder card into Dungeon Deck. Organize monster cards in ascending health order near Dungeon Deck. When placeholder card is drawn, replace with top monster card.
	\item Trophies - Trophy effects must be used every time they are present in your hand, regardless of you being in village, the dungeon, preparing, or resting.
	\item React Abilities - Can be used on another player's turn. Only useable once per player's turn. Can use multiple copies of the same card multiple times per turn.
	\item Monster Global effects impact all players, heroes, and/or monsters while in play in the dungeon hall.
	\item Guardians - Guardian monsters are immune to any ability or affect that would cause them to elave the dungeon hall, or change their position in it, until they are defeated. They don't retreat to the bottom of the Dungeon Deck when victorious. The Thunderstone Bearer cannot be defeated if another Guardian is present in the Dungeon Hall.
	\item Curses - Curses are not affected by monster traits or effects that don't specifically target curse cards. When a curse is destroyed place it back on the curse deck.
