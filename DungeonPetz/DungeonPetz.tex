\section*{Gameplay}
The game is played out over 4 or 5 rounds consisting of 6 Phases.

\subsection*{Phase 1 - Setup}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Getting Income - Starting player and person to the left get 1 Gold, others take 2. \textbf{2/3:} First player takes 1 Gold, other(s) take 2 Gold.
	\item Reveal New Information (Note Round 1) - Turn over the first unrevealed exhibition and customer tiles.
	\item Adding New Stuff (Not Round 1)
		\begin{itemizeCustom}
			\item \textbf{2/3:} Move each neutral Imp to the next space following the arrows. If they end on an action space it is blocked.
			\item New Food - The current round's exhibition tile says how much food to put in each market stall. \textbf{2/3: } If neutral Imp is blocking action space the corresponding stall has no food. If on neutral green square then 1 less vegetable token in mixed-food. If on neutral red square then 1 less meat in mixed-food.
			\item New Artifacts - Remove any existing artifacts and replace with new ones. \textbf{2/3:} If neutral Imp is blocking the action space, do not add new artifacts.
			\item New Cages - Take lowest leftover cage and place in top pit. Discard all others. Deal out 2 new cages. \textbf{2/3:} If neutral Imp is blocking an action space, only deal out 1 new cage.
			\item New Addons - Move lower addon and place it in top spot (if it exists). Deal new addon to lower space. \textbf{2/3:} If nuetral Imp is blocking the action space, skip this step. Don't add or discard any addons this round.
			\item New Pets - Discard all pets in upper corral and add 1 meat for each pet to meat stand. All pets in lower corral grow. Increase to level 3. Move to upper corral. Deal 3 new baby pets set to level 2. \textbf{2/3:} If old pet action spot is blocked, remove left most pet being moved up from lower corral. If lower corral action space is blocked, only deal 2 new pets.
		\end{itemizeCustom}
\end{enumerateCustom}

\subsection*{Phase 2 - Shopping}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Group Imps - Players secretly divide their Imps and Gold into groups. Place groups on exits on board. Each group must have at least 1 Imp. Can have at most 6 groups.
	\item Choosing actions
		\begin{itemizeCustom}
			\item Biggest Groups Go First - Find biggest group, send to action space first. Break ties by actions being taken in turn order starting with First Player.
			\item Possible actions - Send group to unoccupied action space. Put any gold in group into bank. All Imps go to space. Immediately perform action. Or keep the group home. Put all Imps in group and gold back into storage on board.
		\end{itemizeCustom}
\end{enumerateCustom}

\textbf{Action Explanations:}
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Getting Food - Take all corresponding spaces food and place into left-most storage on board.
	\item Getting Artifacts - Take both and put in storage on board.
	\item Choosing a Cage - Must have $\ge$ 2 Imps in group to take action space. May Immediately: Replace existing cage (and move all contents to new one) or place on empty space. Or may wait to place cage until start of Phase 3.
	\item Choosing an Addon - Take on addon and: Replace existing addon on cage or place on empty space. Or wait until start of Phase 3 to place.
	\item Buying a Pet - Group must have gold to take this action. Put pet anywhere on Pet Display Board. Don't have to put into cage until Phase 3. Probably will want to get a cage for it if you don't have one.
	\item Inviting New Imps - Take all Imps from Progress Board for this and any previous round. Place Imps with group.
	\item Visiting the Hospital - Draw one Potion Card. If any Imps in hospital, add them to the group.
	\item Volunteer for Judging - Move minion figure to the space marked 2 at the exhibition tent.
	\item Book Time on the Platform - Imps here don't return at end of round. They move to right of platform. When selling pet, take Imp from right side or action space and put in Pet's cage. Can only sell one Pet from platform, so Imps return at most 1 per round.
\end{itemizeCustom}

\subsection*{Phase 3 - Need Cards}

\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Arrange Cages and Addons - Place any cages and addons purchased this round in their final locations.
	\item Pets - Each pet must be put in a cage. Previously placed pets may be moved. Manure doesn't move with pet. Suffering and Mutation tokens do. Any extra pets are removed from the game. Pets may also be voluntarily released.
	\item Drawing Need Cards - For each revealed colored bar on pet, draw Need card of that color. Drawing can be done in any order. If a player wants, everyone goes in player order.
	\item Assign Need Cards to Pets - Assign each pet one card for each revealed color bar. They must match. Place each pets cards face down near it. A Potion may act as a Need Card of any color.
\end{enumerateCustom}

\subsection*{Phase 4 - Showing Off}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Evaluating Needs - Flip over all Need cards and resolve their effects.
	\begin{itemizeCustom}
		\item Hunger - Spend one food token per hunger card (of Pet's type) or assign one suffering token. If number of suffering tokens $>$ Pet's level it dies.
		\item Poop - Add 1 Manure token for each Poop Need.
		\item Play - For each Play Need, employ 1 Imp to entertain or assign one suffering token. Only available Imp on Burrow Board can be used. One Imp meets 1 Play need for each adjacent cage.
		\item Anger - If number of Anger Needs $>$ Strength of Cage (Red number) it tries to escape. Try to catch it with Imps: Need 1 Imp from Burrow Board for each unmet Anger Need. Move them to hospital. Otherwise, it escapes.
		\item Magic - If number of Magic Needs $>$ Antimagic of Cage (Purple number) it gets 1 mutation for each unmet Magic Need. If it has 2 mutations you lose the Pet.
		\item Disease - If number of Disease Needs + number of Manure in Cage $>$ 2 then get 1 Suffering Token $+$ total $-$ 2. Note that Disease Needs are evaluated after Poop Needs!
		\item Potion - If you played a potion to fulfil a need you must discard one card of the color that it replaced from your hand.
	\end{itemizeCustom}
	\item Exhibition - Exhibition tile tells you if Single-Pet or Full-Display Exhibition (top-left icon). Light frame images depict score increase. Dark frame depicts score decrease. Each symbol worth 1 (times any modifier on exhibit). Note, in Full-Display Manure in empty cages still counts.
	\item Move minions based on exhibition score. If points $\le$ 2 leave minion on 0 space. Players get Reputation points according to drawing on the board. If minion is on 0 you don't get any points. If players tied, each gets reputation for that place minus the number of players that tied with them.
	\item Remove the Exhibition tile from the board.
	\item Losing a Pet - If you lost a pet previously, remove it from the game. It doesn't count in the exhibition. Any Manure tokens stay in the cage. Lost 1 reputation point for each 10 points you have.
\end{enumerateCustom}

\subsection*{Phase 5 - Business}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Sell a Pet ($\ge$ Round 3)
		\begin{itemizeCustom}
			\item Customer will buy 1 Pet level $\ge$ 4 from each player.
			\item Light frame icons = + score; Dark frame icons = - score.
			\item Customer care only about icons, not Need Card color. Manure icon refers to icon on Need Card, not manure in cage.
			\item If Selling from Platform, reputation gained = score $x$ 3. Take Imp from platform and place in Pet's (now empty) cage. Otherwise score $x$ 2.
			\item Get Gold as depicted on Pet. You lose 2 Gold if Pet is Mutated. You may have to pay Gold to sell the Pet!
			\item Remove Customer till from board.
		\end{itemizeCustom}
	\item Discard all need cards from Pets.
	\item Use unused Imps. One Imp may clean 2 Manure tokens from \emph{empty} cages. Full cages can't be cleaned. Get one Gold for each remaining Imp.
\end{enumerateCustom}

\subsection*{Phase 6 - Aging}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Age Pets. Increase age by number of arrows on Pet's right window.
	\item Age food. Remove all food in the right most chambers. Move all food right one chamber.
	\item Imps return. Take back Imps on Pet Display Board and from action spaces except the platform. Move Imps on platform action space to the right of platform. Leave all Imps in the hospital. Move exhibition minion figure back to 0 space.
\end{enumerateCustom}

\subsection*{Prepare for Next Round}
Move Progress Marker on Progress Board and pass Start Player left. Before last round, give to player with lowest reputation. If tied, pass it left until it reaches one of the tied players. \textbf{2/3:} Just pass the token to the left. This gives each player the token twice.

\section*{Final Scoring}
Final scoring consists of two final (and separate) exhibitions.
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Business Acumen Exhibition. $\frac{1}{2}$ point per Gold. 1 point per Food token, Artifact token, and Potion card in hand. Lose 2 points per Imp not on Burrow Board. This includes Imps in hospital, on platform, and on Progress Board. Move scoring minion based on earned reputation. Move back 1 space for a $\frac{1}{2}$ point. Lose 1 reputation per negative exhibition point.
	\item Pet Display Exhibition. 2 point per Pet. 1 point per Cage (including default) and Addon. Lose 1 per Suffering, Manure, and Mutation token.
\end{itemizeCustom}
