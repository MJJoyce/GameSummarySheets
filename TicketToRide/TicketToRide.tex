\section*{Setup}
\begin{enumerateCustom} 
	\item Give each player their own set of train pieces
	\item Place the score trackers on the correct corner of the board
	\item Shuffle the route deck
		\begin{enumerateCustom}
			\item Give each player 3
			\item Players must keep \emph{at least} 2
			\item These are kept secret to the player
			\item Set deck to side of board
		\end{enumerateCustom}
	\item Shuffle the train deck
		\begin{enumerateCustom}
			\item Give each player 4
			\item Place 5 face up cards and deck next to board
		\end{enumerateCustom}
	\item Set out \textbf{Longest Path Bonus} card next to board
\end{enumerateCustom}

\section*{Goal of the Game}
The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Players get points by:
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Claiming a route between two adjacent cities on the map
	\item Completing a \emph{continuous} path between the cities on one of the destination tickets
	\item Having the longest continuous path at the end of the game
\end{itemizeCustom}

\section*{Player Turn}
Perform 1 of the following:
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Draw 2 train cards
		\begin{itemizeCustom}
			\item Cards can be drawn from face-up options, the \textbf{train deck}, or a combination of both
			\item Only 1 card can be drawn if a face-up locomotive is taken
			\item Second draw can never be a face-up locomotive 
			\item If face up card is drawn first, replenish from deck \emph{before} drawing a second card from the train deck or available face up cards
		\end{itemizeCustom}
	\item Draw new route cards
		\begin{itemizeCustom}
			\item Give player 3 cards from top of \textbf{destination deck}
			\item The player must keep \emph{at least} 1
		\end{itemizeCustom}
	\item Claim a route
		\begin{itemizeCustom}
			\item Return number of \emph{matching} train cards from hand
			\item Locomotives count as wild cards and can be any color
			\item Returned train cards must match color of route
			\item Gray routes require any colored set of train cards
			\item Place player's trains on each space of route
			\item Double routes only count as single routes in 2 and 3 player games
			\item Give player points depending on route length. Check board for values
		\end{itemizeCustom}
\end{itemizeCustom}

\section*{End Game}
The game ends when a player has 2 or less plastic trains left. Everyone, including the player, gets one final turn.

Then the players calculate their score as follows:
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Players should already have accumulated their scores for claiming routes on the score tracker
	\item Add each \textbf{Destination ticket} value if completed, subtract if not
	\item The player with the longest continuous path of trains gets 10 bonus points
	\item If two players tied, use number of completed destination tickets, otherwise use \textbf{Longest Continuous Path}, else fist fight
\end{enumerateCustom}
