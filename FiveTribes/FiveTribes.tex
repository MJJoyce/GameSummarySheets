\section*{Setup}
\begin{itemizeCustom}
    \item Take player components
        \begin{itemizeCustom}
            \item 2 Player: Use all pink and blue components
            \item 3-4 Player: One player marker and 8 camels
        \end{itemizeCustom}
    \item Each player gets 9 \$5 coins and 5 \$1 coin. Keep coins face down.
    \item Mix 30 board tiles and place randomly face up in 5x6 grid to form the Sultanate.
    \item Mix all meeples in bag and place 3 randomly on each tile.
    \item Place bid order and turn order tracks near board.
    \item Randomly place player markers onto bid order track to determine initial bid order.
    \item Shuffle resource cards and place top 9 cards in row near draw pile.
    \item Shuffle Djinn cards and place top 3 near draw pile.
    \item Place Palaces, Palm Trees, and all remaining coins near the board.
\end{itemizeCustom}

\section*{Goal of the Game}
Maneuver the five local tribes, invoke power Djinn, and gain influence to be come the new Sultan.

\section*{Game Turn}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
    \item Bid for turn order
    \item Player actions
    \item Clean up
\end{enumerateCustom}

\subsection*{Bid for Turn Order}
In order of markers on bid order turn track, take player marker, place on turn order track, and pay amount indicated on board. If a player bids zero and there is already some markers on the zero spots then first "push down" the existing markers. The last player to bid 0 will go before any other players who already bid zero. Highest value marker goes first.

\subsection*{Player Actions}
A player takes all the following actions before passing play to the next turn order marker owner.

\subsubsection*{Move Turn Marker}
Place turn order marker onto first empy spot on bid order track.

\subsubsection*{Move Meeples}
Select a tile with at least 1 meeple on it. Take all meeples from that tile and move them to onto adjacent tiles, drop 1 meeple on each tile you pass through, until you run out of meeples. You must follow the following 3 rules:
\begin{itemizeCustom}
    \item The last meeple that you drop must be onto a tile with at least 1 meeple of that color on it. Note, you pick the order that you drop meeples in on all tiles.
    \item No moving diagonally.
    \item No immediate backtracking to a tile you just passed through.
\end{itemizeCustom}

\subsubsection*{Tile Control Check}
After placing the final meeple, pick up all meeples of that color from the tile. You should have at least 2 meeples of the same color now. If doing so removes all the meeples form that tile, take control of it and place a camel of your color on it.

\subsubsection*{Tribes Actions}
Now do the action of the tribe that you're holding.
\begin{itemizeCustom}
    \item Yellow Vizier Tribe: Place in front of you. Score at end of game.
    \item White Elders Tribe: Place in front of your. Score at end of game and spend during the game to acquire/invoke Djinns.
    \item Green Merchants Tribe: Place back in bag and take number of face up resource cards from row, starting at beginning. Do not replace any resource cards yet.
    \item Blue Builders Tribe: Place back in bag and take gold coins as follows:
        \begin{itemizeCustom}
            \item Count surrounding Blue tiles including the one you ended on.
            \item Multiply by the number of blue meeples you took.
            \item Optionally, discard 1 or more slave card(s) to increment the multiplier factor by 1 per slave.
        \end{itemizeCustom}
    \item Red Assassins Tribe: Place back in bag. Kill one other meeple. This meeple can be either:
        \begin{itemizeCustom}
            \item 1 meeple of the color of choice on a tile no further away than the number of assassins. May discard 1 or more slaves to increase range. If this empties a tile of all its meeples you gain control of that tile. Place a camel on it.
            \item 1 yellor or white meeple currently held by an opponent
        \end{itemizeCustom}
\end{itemizeCustom}

\subsubsection*{Tile Actions}
Perform the action on the tile where the last meeple was placed. You do not get to perform the action on a second tile that you may have acquired. If the action symbol is marked with a red array, the action is COMPULSORY.

\subsubsection*{Merchandise Sale (Optional)}
You may sale one or more suit of Merchandise cards to collect money from the band. All cards must be different. You cannot sell slaves.

\subsection*{Clean Up}
Replace all resource and Djinn cards that were taken. When replacing cards, shift any remaining cards to the front of the row first.

\section*{End Game}
The game ends at the end of the current turn when either:
\begin{itemizeCustom}
    \item A player drops his last camel on a tile. All other players are given a chance to take their actions for this turn as well.
    \item No more legal meeple movement is possible. Current player and any other players may take other actions.
\end{itemizeCustom}

\section*{Scoring}
Victory points are scored in the following ways:
\begin{itemizeCustom}
    \item 1 VP for each gold coin
    \item 1 VP for each Vizier (yellow meeple) + 10 VP for each opponent who has less Viziers than you
    \item 2 VP per Elder (white meeple)
    \item Sum of all VPs for Djinns
    \item 3 VP for each palm tree on all your tiles (one with a camel on it)
    \item 5 VP for each palace on all your tiles
    \item Sum of all VPs on all your tiles
    \item Sum of VPs for each series of Merchandise (not including slaves) that are all different
\end{itemizeCustom}
