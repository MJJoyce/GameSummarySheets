\section*{Setup}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Place the 9 \emph{Building} tiles numbered 1, 2, and 3 in a 3x3 square.
	\item Place the 12 \emph{Urbanization} tokens in alphabetical order around the board.
	\item Shuffle the remaining \emph{Building} tiles and place in face down piles. For 2 or 3 player game, remove 6 random tiles without peeking!
	\item Form a deck by shuffling the 12 \emph{Urbanization} cards (A to L) and the 9 \emph{Building} cards that correspond to the starting building tiles. In 2 or 3 player game, discard the first 7 cards face up next to the deck.
	\item Sort the \emph{Building} cards numbered 4-20 by color and ascending order.
	\item Each player picks a color and places the resources in the general supply. Take 25/20/18/16 resources for a 2/3/4/5 player game.
	\item Each player gets a screen in their color and 2 \emph{New Hand} tokens.
	\item Give each player 4 character cards. Players take 1 card from their hand and pass the remainder left. Continue until everyone has 3. Then everyone reveals their character cards. In introductory game, each player receives a random set of 3 cards that are identified by the same number.
	\item Place character cards in front of player screen. Take the resources indicated by the starting character cards in the top-left corner. All items go behind your screen.
	\item Deal 4 cards from the deck to each player.
\end{enumerateCustom}

\section*{Goal of the Game}
Players are trying to accrue the most ``success'' points by the end of the game by operating and constructing buildings in the city of Ginkgopolis.

\section*{Playing the Game}
The game is divided into 3 phases:
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Choose a card
	\item Resolve actions
	\item Prepare for the next round
\end{enumerateCustom}

\section*{Choose a Card}
Players simultaneously look at their hand of 4 cards, pick one, and place it face down in front of their screen. The card can be played by itself or with a \emph{Building} tile, depending on the action that you wish to perform. If playing it with a tile, select the tile behind your screen and place it face down on the card. Players may also discard a \emph{New Hand} token to discard all 4 cards and draw 4 new cards.

\section*{Resolve Actions}
Starting with the first player, each player reveals their chosen card(and tile), then resolves the corresponding action. The 3 possible actions are:
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Exploiting: Playing a card by itself
	\item Urbanization: Playing an Urbanization card with a tile
	\item Constructing a floor: Playing a Building card with a tile
\end{itemizeCustom}

\section*{Exploiting}
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item If played only \emph{Urbanization} card, take either a resource or tile from general supply.
	\item If played only \emph{Building} card, take resources designated by tile's color. Red gives resources. Blue gives tiles. Yellow gives ``success'' points. Number of items received is the height of the building.
	\item Get bonuses from cards with \emph{Exploiting} bonuses on the bottom. These are on character cards and cards earned through constructing a floor.
	\item Discard the card.
\end{itemizeCustom}

\section*{Urbanization}
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Replace the corresponding \emph{Urbanization} token with the selected tile. Also place a \emph{Construction Site} pawn and a resource (from behind the player's screen) on the tile.
	\item Place \emph{Urbanization} token orthogonally adjacent to the new tile. If not possible, move other tokens so it can be placed. Tokens must remain in alphabetical order!
	\item Buildings orthogonally adjaced to the new tile are ``utilized'' by the player. Get bonuses as though you had exploited those corresponding tiles cards.
	\item Get bonuses from cards with an \emph{Urbanization} bonus.
	\item Discard the \emph{Urbanization} card.
\end{itemizeCustom}

\section*{Constructing a Floor}
Note, if you don't have the items to perform all these steps you must then Exploit the card and take back all your resources and tiles.
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Return resources from the building being constructed to the corresponding player. If it it a different player, they get a success point for each resource.
	\item Place tile atop the building. If number on tile is less than the covered tile number, pay the difference in success points. If the tiles aren't the same color, discard a resource to general supply.
	\item Place resources equal to height of the building onto the tile. Place \emph{Construction Site} pawn onto tile.
	\item Get bonuses from cards with a \emph{Constructing a floor} bonus.
	\item Keep the card face up in your area. It gives bonuses for the rest of the game.
\end{itemizeCustom}

\section*{Prepare for the Next Round}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item For each tile with a \emph{Construction Site} pawn on it, find the corresponding card in one of the stacks of \emph{Building} cards.
	\item Shuffle the deck, discard pile, and new cards to form a new deck.
	\item If 2 or 3 players, discard the top 7 cards before dealing players new hands.
	\item Remove all \emph{Construction Site} pawns.
\end{enumerateCustom}
