\section*{Setup}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Place the ``pond tile'' in the center and place the panda and gardener on it.
	\item Shuffle the Land Plot tiles and place them face down.
	\item Set out irrigation channels and improvement tiles.
	\item Shuffle and set out the Objective cards by color and the Emperor card.
	\item Give each player a player board, 2 matching action chips, and 1 objective card of each type (keep them hidden).
\end{enumerateCustom}

\section*{Goal of the Game}
\section*{Player Turn}
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Determine Weather - Roll the Weather Die and apply the effect
		\begin{itemizeCustom}
			\item Sun - Additional unique action.
			\item Rain - Place bamboo on any irrigated tile (limit 4 sections).
			\item Wind - Player \emph{may} take identical actions this round.
			\item Storm - Place panda on any plot. It eats a section of bamboo.
			\item Clouds - Take an improvement tile. May play it or keep for later. If none available, choose another climate condition.
			\item ? - Choose any condition to apply.
		\end{itemizeCustom}
	\item Perform Actions - Select two separate actions on player board and perform them in any order.
		\begin{itemizeCustom}
			\item Plots - Draw 3 plots and select 1 to place. Place other two face down on top of draw pile in order desired. Valid placement is adjacent to special ``pond tile'' or adjacent to two existing plots. If plot is irrigated when placed (Next to Pond, has watershed improvement, next to irrigation channel) a bamboo section automatically grows.
			\item Irrigation Channel - Take an irrigation channel and either play immediately or store for later. Channels can be played at any time during turn from player's reserve without using an action. Place channels on border of two plots. Network must originate from pond tile.
			\item Gardener - Move gardener in straight line any number of plots in any direction. Can't move over empty spaces. Grow section of bamboo on plot where movement finishes and adjacent plots of same color. Plots must be irrigated and 4 sections is max height of bamboo.
			\item Panda - Move panda in straight line any number of plots. Can't move over empty spaces. Panda eats a section of bamboo where movement ends. Player keeps section on player board.
			\item Objectives - Draw an objective card from category of choosing and add to hand. Max hand size is 5.
