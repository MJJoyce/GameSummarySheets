\section*{Action Explanations}
Corporation: Installing Cards
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item \textbf{Assets} and \textbf{upgrades} are played unrezzed. 
	\item When installing, Corp can first \textbf{trash} cards in that server. The trashed cards go to the \textbf{Archives} faceup if rezzed, facedown if unrezzed.
	\item A remote server can be created by installing there. If \textbf{ice} is used, it is \textbf{empty}. Can still be run against.
	\item \textbf{Agendas/Assets:} Can only be installed in remote server. Only one \textbf{agenda} or \textbf{asset} per remote server. \textbf{Upgrades} don't have to be trashed!
	\item \textbf{Upgrades:} Installed in server \textbf{root} when put into central server, otherwise put with agenda/asset. No install limit. Only one \textbf{region} subtype installed per \emph{server}.
	\item \textbf{Ice:} Installed in front of any server (sideways). Installed in outermost position. Must pay cost equal to number of \textbf{ice} in server. Already installed \textbf{ice} may be trashed to reduce install cost.
\end{itemizeCustom}

Corporation: Advancing a Card
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item One advancement token placed on installed card. \textbf{Agendas} can always be advanced, others if they state so.
	\item There is no limit to how many times a card can be advanced. 
	\item When \textbf{agenda} is advanced to its advancement requirement, it can be scored. Scoring does \emph{not} cost a \textbf{click}. Scoring is \emph{not} mandatory.
\end{itemizeCustom}

Runner: Installing Cards
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item \textbf{Programs:} Pay install cost, place faceup in program row. If installed programs' memory costs is greater than Runner's memory units, programs must be trashed.
	\item \textbf{Resources:} Pay install cost and place faceup in resource row.
	\item \textbf{Hardware:} Pay install cost and place faceup in hardware row. Limit of one \textbf{console} subtype installed. Can't trash to install another.
\end{itemizeCustom}

Runner: Runs
%\begin{itemizeCustom}
	%\item Primary interation between Corporation's \textbf{Ice} and Runner's \textbf{Icebreakers}. Icebreaker break ice subroutines if level is greater/equal to ice's level.
	%\item \textbf{Initiation phase:} Runner declares target server. Receives 1 \textbf{credit} for each \textbf{bad publicity} on Corporation. If ice protecting the server, proceed to \textbf{Confrontation phase}, otherwise go to \textbf{Access phase}.
	%\item \textbf{Confrontaton phase:} Runner approaches ice starting from the outermost. When approached any piece of ice except the first of the run, the Runner may \textbf{Jack Out} and end the run. For each piece of ice, if the ice is rezzed then the runner encounters it. Otherwise, if the Corporation rezzes the card, the Runner enounters it, otherwise the Runner passes the ice. For an encountered piece of ice, the Runner has the opportunity to break subroutines on the ice in any order. Any unbroken subroutines then trigger and the ice is passed, assuming the run wasn't ended by a subroutine. If all the ice protecting server are passed, proceed to \textbf{Access phase}.
	%\item \textbf{Access phase:} The Access phase is different depending on the server run against. Cards can be trashed by paying the trash cost (trash can icon) on the card.
	%\begin{itemizeCustom}
		%\item \textbf{R\&D:} Access top card and any upgrades in root. Cards aren't shown to Corporation unless they are scored, trashed, or forced by card text.
		%\item \textbf{HQ:} Access one random card and any upgrades in root. 
		%\item \textbf{Archives:} Access all cards in \textbf{Archives} and any upgrades in root. All cards are turned faceup and order does not need to be maintained. All \textbf{agendas} are stolen, but cannot trash any cards already in the \textbf{Archives}.
		%\item \textbf{Remote Server:} Access all cards in server.
	%\end{itemizeCustom}
%\end{itemizeCustom}
\\PT - Paid abilities can be triggered. NIR - Non-ice cards can be rezzed.\\
Anything on same line can be resolved in order of choice.
\begin{enumerateCustom}
	\item Declare target server. Get credits for \textbf{bad publicity}. If ice, goto 2, else goto 4
	\item Runner \textbf{Approaches} outermost unapproached ice.
		\begin{enumerateCustom}
			\item PT
			\item Continue run? If \textbf{Jacks Out} (not first ice of run), goto 6
			\item Approached ice can be rezzed, PT, NIR
			\item If approached ice is rezzed, goto 3. If no more ice, goto 4. If more ice, goto 2.
		\end{enumerateCustom}
	\item Runner \textbf{Encounters} ice (``When encountered'' met)
		\begin{enumerateCustom}
			\item Icebreakers interact with ice, PT
			\item Resolve all unbroken subroutines. If run ends, goto 6. Else, if more ice, goto 2, else goto 4.
		\end{enumerateCustom}
	\item Runner \textbf{Approaches} server
		\begin{enumerateCustom}
			\item PT
			\item Continue run? If \textbf{Jacks Out} goto 6
			\item PT, NIR
			\item Run is successful (``When successful'' met)
			\item Access cards, goto 5. If \textbf{R\&D}, top card + upgrades. If \textbf{HQ}, one random card + upgrades. If \textbf{Archives}, all cards. If \textbf{remote server}, all cards in server but ice.
		\end{enumerateCustom}
	\item Run ends
	\item Run ends and is \textbf{Unsuccessful} (``When unsuccessful'' met)
\end{enumerateCustom}

\section*{Additional Rules}
Traces:
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Some card abilities start a trace. Trace$^{\textrm{x}}$, \textbf{x} is the base strength.
	\item First, Corporation can increase strength by 1 per \textbf{credit}
	\item Next, Runner can increase link strength by 1 per \textbf{credit}. Base strength equal to \textbf{Links} in play.
	\item If trace $>$ link, trace is successful. 
\end{itemizeCustom}

Tags
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Some cards place a tag marker on the Runner. If Runner has at least one tag, it is \textbf{Tagged}. When tag, Corporation can trash resources as an action and the Runner can remove a tag as an action.
\end{itemizeCustom}

Damage
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item \textbf{Meat/Net Damage:} Differ only by name. Runner randomly trashes a card from \textbf{grip} for each such damage.
	\item \textbf{Brain Damage:} Runner randomly trashes one card from \textbf{grip} and has maximum hand size reduced by 1. Take brain damage token to track this.
\end{itemizeCustom}

Hosting
\begin{itemizeCustom}
	\item Some cards are installed on other cards (``hosted card'') and some allow cards to be installed on them (``host card''). Some cards can also host counters and tokens. If a trigger cost requires a hosted counter, the counters must be spent from the card the ability is on.
