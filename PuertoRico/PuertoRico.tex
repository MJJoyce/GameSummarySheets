	\item Place role cards based on number of players. 3 players: All cards but both prospectors / 4 players: All cards but one prospector / 5 players: All cards
	\item Place cargo ships based on number of players. 3/4/5 players : 4-6/5-7/6-8 cargo spaces
	\item Place out goods pieces and the trading house tile
	\item Place colonist ship with <number of player> colonists on it
	\item Place colonists out based on number of players. 3/4/5 players : 55/75/95 colonists
\end{enumerateCustom}

\section*{Goal of the Game}
Players build plantations and buildings, produce goods, and then sell or ship them. Be the player with the most points at the end of the game.

\section*{Game Flow}
Each round, the \textbf{governor} begins by taking an available role card. All players take the chosen action in clockwise order. The next player chooses a role and all players take that action as before. The person who chose the role gets the \emph{privilege} listed on the card. After all players have picked a role, place 1 doubloon on the remaining unused role cards. Return all picked role cards back to the table and pass the \textbf{governor} card to the next player in clockwise order.

\section*{Roles}
\subsection*{The Settler}
Each player takes and places a plantation tile. \textbf{Privilege:} The settler may take and place a quarry \emph{instead}. At the end of the phase, remove untaken plantation tiles and draw replacements.

\subsection*{The Mayor}
Each player takes colonists in player order from the colonist ship and then places \emph{all their colonists} on any empty spaces on their player board. Any colonist(s) that can't be placed may be stored on San Juan for a future Mayor phase. \textbf{Privilege:} The mayor may take an additional colonist from the \emph{supply}. After the phase, the Mayor places 1 colonist on the ship for each empty space on \emph{buildings} of \emph{all} players.

\subsection*{The Builder}
Each player may build a building by paying its cost (left number in the circle). \textbf{Privilege:} The builder pays one less doubloon. Each occupied quarry that a player owns may reduce the cost of building a building by 1 doubloon. Each column of buildings has a maximum number of quarry cost reduction(s) that can be applied. These are rock icons at the top of each column on the game board. The builder's privilege is in addition to the quarry reduction.

\subsection*{The Craftsman}
Each player takes goods from the supply according to his production ability in player order. \textbf{Privilege:} After all players have taken goods, take an additional good (of those you can produce) from the supply.
